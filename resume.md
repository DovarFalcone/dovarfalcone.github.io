## Work Experience
---
### Cargill FSQR Data Coordinator
#### _2021-Present:_

- In my time at Cargill, I saw an opportunity to streamline our paper-based processes and bring our protein facilities into the digital age. In this role, I implemented a paperless system across all facilities, driving significant operational efficiencies and cost savings. I designed custom forms for each plant to replace paper copies, ensuring clean data collection with minimal future maintenance requirements. 
- To manage the influx of requests during the transition, I created a ticketing support model, ensuring that everyone's concerns were addressed in a timely and efficient manner. 
- Finally, I utilized my business intelligence engineering skills to build reports from scratch using PostgreSQL and PowerBi. This allowed me to analyze and report on real-time data collected from all plants, giving the leadership team insight into our operations' performance.

### Cargill FSQR Supervisor
#### _2020-2021:_

- As an FSQR supervisor at Cargill Meat Solutions, I oversaw a team of technicians responsible for enforcing regulatory and corporate policies. Recognizing that our daily data entry tasks were inefficient and labor-intensive, I developed and implemented automated spreadsheets and Microsoft products, reducing our workload while improving our accuracy. 
- To cut costs, I implemented a water sampling program that reduced testing, supply, and labor expenses by $30,000 annually.
- Additionally, I strengthened relationships between the FSQR and Ops teams, creating a highly functioning group.

### Select Breeders Services - Horse Care and Facility Supervisor
#### _2019-2020:_

- At Select Breeders Services, I coordinated all aspects of animal welfare, employee scheduling, and inventory management for a horse breeding facility. I supervised and trained a team of up to 10 employees, including H2A Visa workers. 
- After identifying an underutilized arena, I developed and executed a project plan to add additional stalls, generating an estimated $10,000 per month in revenue. 
- I also created spreadsheets to track the movement of horses in and out of the facility and implemented weekly quality checks of all vehicles and facilities.

### Furlyn Farm and Stables, LLC - Facility Manager
#### _2012-2018:_

- As a facility manager at Furlyn Farm and Stables, I managed and supported a 75-acre family-owned horse farm. I oversaw all aspects of the farm's operations, from maintenance and repairs to staffing and customer service. My leadership and problem-solving skills ensured that the farm ran smoothly.
