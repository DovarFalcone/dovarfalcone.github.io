## Work Experience
---
### Cargill FSQR Data Coordinator
#### _2021-Present:_

- At Cargill, I embarked on a transformative journey to modernize our protein facilities by transitioning from paper-based processes to a digital ecosystem. By implementing a paperless system and designing customized forms for each plant, I successfully drove significant operational efficiencies and cost savings while ensuring clean data collection with minimal maintenance requirements. 
- Recognizing the importance of effective communication and timely support during the transition, I created a ticketing support model that addressed everyone's concerns efficiently. This collaborative approach fostered seamless teamwork and ensured a smooth transition for all stakeholders.
- Leveraging my expertise in business intelligence engineering, I developed compelling reports from scratch using PostgreSQL and PowerBI. These reports empowered the leadership team with real-time insights into our operations' performance. Notably, I built a raw material quality audit report that delivered key performance indicators (KPIs), promoting communication and collaboration between different segments. Through cross-team collaboration, I standardized data collection processes, enabling us to leverage PowerBI's capabilities effectively.
- Additionally, I crafted a real-time paginated SSRS report, providing user-friendly access to accurate data during audits. This report showcased my technical prowess and attention to detail, ensuring that stakeholders could easily navigate and extract the information they needed.
- Another notable achievement was developing an advanced report using R, which generated Statistical Process Control (SPC) X-Bar and R charts. This data-driven approach enhanced our ability to monitor and optimize processes, further solidifying my expertise in data analysis and visualization.

### Cargill FSQR Supervisor
#### _2020-2021:_

- As an FSQR supervisor at Cargill Meat Solutions, I oversaw a team of technicians responsible for enforcing regulatory and corporate policies. Recognizing that our daily data entry tasks were inefficient and labor-intensive, I developed and implemented automated spreadsheets and Microsoft products, reducing our workload while improving our accuracy. 
- To cut costs, I implemented a water sampling program that reduced testing, supply, and labor expenses by $30,000 annually.
- Additionally, I strengthened relationships between the FSQR and Ops teams, creating a highly functioning group.

### Select Breeders Services - Horse Care and Facility Supervisor
#### _2019-2020:_

- At Select Breeders Services, I coordinated all aspects of animal welfare, employee scheduling, and inventory management for a horse breeding facility. I supervised and trained a team of up to 10 employees, including H2A Visa workers. 
- After identifying an underutilized arena, I developed and executed a project plan to add additional stalls, generating an estimated $10,000 per month in revenue. 
- I also created spreadsheets to track the movement of horses in and out of the facility and implemented weekly quality checks of all vehicles and facilities.

### Furlyn Farm and Stables, LLC - Facility Manager
#### _2012-2018:_

- As a facility manager at Furlyn Farm and Stables, I managed and supported a 75-acre family-owned horse farm. I oversaw all aspects of the farm's operations, from maintenance and repairs to staffing and customer service. My leadership and problem-solving skills ensured that the farm ran smoothly.
