I executed the command `jupyter nbconvert --to html notebook.ipynb` in order to perform a conversion of a Jupyter Notebook file to the html format.

I executed the command `jupyter nbconvert --to markdown notebook.ipynb` in order to perform a conversion of a Jupyter Notebook file to the Markdown format. The output of this command, in the form of a Markdown document, was subsequently transferred to this site.

```python
import pyodbc
import pandas as pd
import os
import json
import yaml
```


```python
with open('creds.yaml', 'r') as file:
   creds = yaml.safe_load(file)
```


```python
server = creds['usfoodcon']['server'] 
database = creds['usfoodcon']['database'] 
username = creds['usfoodcon']['username'] 
password = creds['usfoodcon']['password']  
cnxn = pyodbc.connect('DRIVER={PostgreSQL Unicode};SERVER='+server+';DATABASE='+database+';UID='+username+';PWD='+ password)
cursor = cnxn.cursor()
```


```python
query = '''SELECT "Country"
, "Commodity"
, "UOM"
, "Category"
, "FoodValue"
, "FoodValue" "DollarValue"
, "YearNum"

FROM us_food_imports
where "Country" NOT IN (
	'REST OF WORLD',
	'WORLD (Quantity)',
	'WORLD'	
)
and (
	"Category" ILIKE 'Meats'
	or "Category" ILIKE 'Animals'
)
and "YearNum" = 2021
order by "Country"
;
'''
```


```python
df = pd.read_sql(query, cnxn)
print(df.head(10))
```
