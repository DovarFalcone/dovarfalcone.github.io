2. Adjust the parameters for edge-preserving smoothing, Gaussian blur, and Canny edge detection using the sliders in the sidebar.

3. Click on the "Generate line drawing" button to generate the line drawing.

4. The input and output images will be displayed on the page. The generated line drawing will also be saved as a GIF file, which can be downloaded by clicking on the "Download GIF" button.
