> Best made with [Furtkevic Pie Crust](https://dovarfalcone.github.io/2023-01-13-Furtkevic-Pie-Crust/){:target="_blank"}

## Ingredients

| Ingredient | Amount|
| :------ |:--- |
| Apples *Use Macintosh, Granny Smith, honey crisp - never red delicious or yellow* | 6 - 8 |
| Sugar | 1 Cup |
| Lemon Juice | 1 tbsp |
| Cinnamon | 2 tbsp |
| Egg | 1 |

## Instructions

1. Peel, core, and thinly slice 6 to 8 apples. Avoid using Red Delicious or Yellow Delicious apples.

2. In a mixing bowl, toss the apple slices with lemon juice, sugar, and cinnamon. 

3. Pour the apple mixture into the pie crust, spreading it out evenly.

4. Roll out the second pie crust and place it on top of the apples. Cut slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape.

5. In a small bowl, whisk together one egg. Brush the egg wash over the top crust to give it a shiny finish. Optionally, you can sprinkle a little sugar on top of the crust.

6. Bake the pie in a preheated oven at 450F for 40 to 50 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly. 

Enjoy!
