## Ingredients

| Ingredient | Amount|
| :------ |:--- |
| Apples *Use Macintosh, Granny Smith, honey crisp - never red delicious or yellow* | 6 - 8 |
| Sugar | 1 Cup |

## Instructions

1. Peel, core about six to eight apples.  Use Macintosh, Granny Smith, honey crisp - never red delicious or yellow. 

2. Thinly slice the apples and toss in a bowl with some lemon juice - about a tablespoon, a cup of sugar and two tablespoons of cinnamon.  

3. Pour into pie shell.  Roll a pie top and cut slits for steam.  

4. Whip another egg and shellac the top crust.  This makes the pie shiny.  You can sprinkle sugar lightly on top too if you want. 

5. Bake at 450 degrees for 40 to 50 minutes.  

Enjoy!
