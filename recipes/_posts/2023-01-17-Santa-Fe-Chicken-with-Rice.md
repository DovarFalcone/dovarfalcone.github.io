**Notes:** A delicious and easy to make one-pan dish that's perfect for busy weeknights.

## Ingredients

| Ingredient | Amount|
| :------ |:--- |
| Chicken Tenderloins | 1/2 lbs |
| Mild Salsa | One 16oz jar |
| Mexican Corn | One 11oz Can |
| Black Beans | One 16oz Can |
| Long Grain Rice | 1 & 1/2 Cup |
| Shredded Monterrey Jack Cheese | 1 Cup |
| Sour Cream (optional) | To Taste|

## Instructions

1. In a large skillet, cook the chicken tenderloins over medium-high heat until browned and cooked through.

2. In a separate pot, bring 1 and 1/2 cups of water to a boil and add 1 and 1/2 cup of rice. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 18-20 minutes or until all the water is absorbed.

3. In the same skillet you cooked the chicken in, add the salsa, corn, and black beans. Mix well and bring the mixture to a simmer.

4. Serve the chicken mixture over cooked rice, and top with shredded Monterrey Jack cheese and a dollop of sour cream (if desired).

5. Enjoy with a side of your choice or as it is.
