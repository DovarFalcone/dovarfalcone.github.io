> I made it from scratch!

## Ingredients

| Ingredient | Amount|
| :------ |:--- |
| Flour | 4 Cups |
| Crisco | 2 Cups |
| Sugar | 1 tbs |
| Egg | 1 |
| Salt | 1 tsp |
| White Vinegar | 1 tsp |

## Instructions

1. In a mixing bowl, blend together the liquid ingredients with your fingers by rubbing your hands together to create a seedy texture.

2. In a separate bowl, beat one egg well. Then, add one teaspoon of white vinegar and 1/2 cup of cold water. Mix these ingredients well.

3. Slowly add the liquid mixture to the flour mixture, and kneed with your hands. Keep adding flour as needed until the dough sticks to itself only and releases from your hands and the bowl.

4. Cover the dough and refrigerate for at least one hour. This will make it easier to roll.

5. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and roll it out on a floured surface for your desired size of pies.

6. Before baking, brush the top of the pies with an egg wash for a golden brown finish.

Enjoy!
