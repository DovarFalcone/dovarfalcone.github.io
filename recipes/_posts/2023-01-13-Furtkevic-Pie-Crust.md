> I made it from scratch!

## Ingredients

| Ingredient | Amount|
| :------ |:--- |
| Flour | 4 Cups |
| Crisco | 2 Cups |
| Sugar | 1 tbs |
| Egg | 1 |
| Salt | 1 tsp |
| White Vinegar | 1 tsp |

## Instructions

1. Mix liquid ingredients together. Blend these together in a bowl with your fingers by rubbing your hands together to make it kind of seedy. 

2. In a separate bowl beat one egg well then add one teaspoon of white vinegar and 1/2 Cup Cold Water. Mix these well. 

3. Then add liquid to flour mixture and kneed with your hands.  Add flour as needed so that the dough sticks to itself only and releases from your hands and bowl.  

3. Refrigerate the dough for at least an hour   This makes it easier to roll. 

4. Roll dough for pies. 

5. Finish with egg wash before baking. 

Enjoy!
