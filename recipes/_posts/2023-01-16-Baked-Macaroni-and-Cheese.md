## Ingredients

| Ingredient | Amount|
| :------ |:--- |
| Elbow Macaroni | 12 ounces |
| Sour Cream | 1/2 Cup |
| Evaporated Fat Free Milk | 12 ounces |
| Shredded Cheddar Cheese | 2 Cups |
| Grated Parmesan | 2 tbsp |
| Dijon Mustard | 1 tbsp |
| Salt | 1/4 tsp |
| Pepper | 1/4 tsp |
| Ground Nutmeg | 1/8 tsp |
| Dried Bread Crumbs | 2 tbsp |


## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 350F and prepare a 4-quart baking dish by spraying it with nonstick spray.

2. Cook macaroni according to the package instructions, then drain and transfer it to a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sour cream.

3. In a saucepan, heat the milk over medium heat until tiny bubbles form (do not boil). Lower the heat and whisk in the shredded cheddar cheese. Cook for 2 minutes while whisking constantly. Remove the saucepan from heat and add the mustard, salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Mix well.

4. Pour the milk mixture over the macaroni and sour cream, and stir well to combine. 

5. Transfer the mixture to the prepared baking dish. In a small bowl, mix together the bread crumbs and grated Parmesan cheese. Sprinkle the mixture over the casserole.

6. Bake the casserole for 30 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and the bread crumbs are golden brown. Let it cool for a few minutes before serving and enjoy your delicious casserole!

Enjoy!
