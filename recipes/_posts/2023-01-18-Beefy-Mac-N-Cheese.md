## Ingredients

| Stewed Tomatoes | 1 Can |
| Sharp Cheddar Cheese | 1 Cup |

## Instructions

1. Cook pasta according to package instructions and drain. Set aside.

2. In a large skillet, brown the ground beef over medium heat. Drain any excess fat.

3. Stir in the tomato sauce, undrained stewed tomatoes, cheddar cheese, and chili powder. Cook over low heat until cheese is melted and well combined.

4. Add the cooked pasta to the skillet and heat for an additional 6-8 minutes or until pasta is heated through.

5. Serve hot, with grated parmesan cheese on top.

6. (Optional) This recipe can be frozen and baked at a later date. To do so, let the beefy macaroni cool completely and then transfer to a freezer-safe container. When ready to bake, thaw the beefy macaroni in the refrigerator and then bake at 350F for 25-30 minutes or until heated through.

7. Enjoy!
