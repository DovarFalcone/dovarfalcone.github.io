## Ingredients

| Ingredient | Amount|
| :------ |:--- |
| Cold Butter *cut into small cubes* | 1 Cup|
| Brown Sugar | 1 Cup |
| Sugar | 1/2 Cup |
| Large Eggs | 2 |
| Cake Flour | 1 & 1/2 Cups |
| All-Purpose Flour | 1 & 1/2 Cups |

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 410F.

2. In a large mixing bowl, use an electric mixer to cream together the cold cubed butter, brown sugar, and sugar for 4 minutes or until creamy.

3. Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition.

4. In a separate mixing bowl, whisk together the cake flour, all-purpose flour, cornstarch, baking soda and salt.

5. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, mixing until just combined. 

6. Stir in the chocolate chips and chopped walnuts (if desired).

7. Form the dough into 8 large balls and place them on a lightly colored baking sheet, spacing them at least 3 inches apart. You may only be able to fit 4 cookies on a tray at a time.

8. Bake for 9-12 minutes or until golden brown on the top.

9. Allow the cookies to rest on the baking sheet for at least 10 minutes to set before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.

10. Enjoy the delicious, soft and chewy Levain Bakery Inspired Chocolate Chip Cookies.
