## Instructions

1. Place chicken breast halves between sheets of waxed paper or plastic wrap. Pound slightly with a meat mallet to even out the thickness. Sprinkle with salt and black pepper.

2. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and add 1 tbsp each of oil and butter. 

3. Once the skillet is hot, add the chicken breasts and cook for 4 minutes on each side or until cooked through. Be careful not to overcook the chicken as it will become dry. Once cooked, transfer the chicken to a warm serving platter.

4. Add chives or green onions, squeeze of lemon, and brandy or cognac, if using, to the skillet. Cook for 15 seconds, whisking constantly.

5. Whisk in parsley, dijon mustard and chicken broth. Stir until the sauce is smooth. Whisk in remaining butter and oil.

6. Pour the sauce over the chicken. Enjoy immediately. 

> Tips: To make this dish even more convenient, pound the chicken breasts flat and freeze them between sheets of plastic wrap for later use. Simply thaw them before cooking.

Enjoy!
